The existing developments on this issue are investigated by generalizing the literature on the basic characteristics and relationship of bitcoin and ethereum prices. Based on the problems and existing research on the topic, the analysis of the relationship between ethereum and bitcoin prices is defined as the goal of the article. A mathematical model of the cryptocurrency relationship analysis is presented, which helps to establish that the relationship is quite close. The main result is the conclusion that a connection exists between the prices of bitcoin and ethereum, and this connection can be used for diversification and risk insurance when trading on the cryptocurrency exchange. The purpose of this article is to identify a tool that can describe the relationship between the price of ethereum and both its volume and the price of bitcoin and can predict their changes over time. This article analyzes the price of ethereum as dependent on the price of bitcoin."
Journal Article,"S M,Mohta M,Rangaswamy S",ETHEREUM PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES â€?A COMPARATIVE STUDY,International Journal of Engineering Applied Sciences and Technology,2022,7,137-142,06 2022,,http://dx.doi.org/10.33564/ijeast.2022.v07i02.018,10.33564/ijeast.2022.v07i02.018,"In recent years, popularity and use of cryptocurrencies has been rising along with their prices and Ethereum is the second most famous cryptocurrency after Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are based on blockchain, which is a distributed and empowered technology that has the power to transform any banking systems. It has become an attractive investment for traders as well as individuals looking to invest. The price of Ethereum varies and is controlled by different factors, such as the crypto market in which it is sold, supply and demand. Ethereum is so valuable because it could be used as cash, we could also pay a portion or part of Ethereum to someone in exchange and it is easily guaranteed by the blockchain. Unlike stocks, Ethereum price is much more variable, as it has a trading time of 24-hours a day without any close time. The paper compares the results of three different models, namely Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) and Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTMs). The dataset consists of the closing price for the last 2000 days that is used to predict both short-term (30 days) and long-term (90 days) Ethereum prices. These prices are being fetched from an API which is in JSON format and are updated every day."

The low barrier of entry and high data availability of the cryptocurrency market makes it an excellent subject of study, from which it is possible to derive insights into the behavior of markets through the application of sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques for the challenging task of stock market prediction. While there have been some previous studies, most of them have focused exclusively on the behavior of?Bitcoin. In this paper, we propose the usage of common machine learning tools and available social media data for predicting the price movement of the?Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple?and?Litecoin?cryptocurrency market movements. We compare the utilization of neural networks (NN), support vector machines (SVM) and random forest (RF) while using elements from Twitter and market data as input features. The results show that it is possible to predict cryptocurrency markets using machine learning and sentiment analysis, where Twitter data by itself could be used to predict certain cryptocurrencies and that NN outperform the other models."
Journal Article,Ah Mand A,Cryptocurrency Returns and Cryptocurrency Uncertainty: A Time-Frequency Analysis,SSRN Electronic Journal,2021,,,2021,2021/10/28,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3950087,10.2139/ssrn.3950087,"This study aims to analyze the time-varying correlation between the cryptocurrency policy uncertainty (UCRY Policy) and cryptocurrency returns. More specifically, it analyzes whether these correlations vary according to the uncertainty attributable to salient events such as China banning ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges attacks, Coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic crisis and the United States (U.S.) Security and Exchange Commission¡¯s (SEC¡¯s) announcement about Ripple. Design/methodology/approach To measure the dynamic relationship, it uses the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002) to consider time variation in UCRY Policy and cryptocurrency returns. The data set encompasses the weekly frequency data of the UCRY Policy and Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), Stellar (XLM), Dash (DASH), Monero (XMR) from 4 September 2016, to 21 February 2021. Findings Empirical findings indicate that the correlations between the UCRY Policy and the BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, XLM, DASH and XMR returns are consistently negative. Thus, an increase in the volatility of the UCRY Policy can lead to a decrease in volatility for BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, XLM, DASH and XMR returns. Besides, these findings indicate that the estimated DCC is not only time-varying but also substantially responsive to salient events, such as China banning ICOs, cryptocurrency exchanges attacks, the Covid-19 pandemic crisis and SEC¡¯s announcement about Ripple. Besides, empirical findings show that cryptocurrency returns are adversely impacted by UCRY Policy during the salient events (China bans ICOs, the hack of cryptocurrency exchanges, Covid-19 crisis), suggesting their failure to act as a hedge or safe-haven asset. Originality/value To the best of the author¡¯s knowledge, this study investigates the time-varying correlation between UCRY Policy and cryptocurrency returns. Besides, this study may be useful for new studies and fill a gap in the finance literature, due to the limited number of studies on the UCRY Policy in the finance literature."
Journal Article,"Singh PK,Pandey AK,Bose SC","A new grey system approach to forecast closing price of Bitcoin, Bionic, Cardano, Dogecoin, Ethereum, XRP Cryptocurrencies",Quality & Quantity,2022,,,07 2022,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-022-01463-0,10.1007/s11135-022-01463-0,"The current study uses the grey forecasting model, EGM (1, 1, ¦Á, ¦È), a generalized form of the classical, even form of grey forecasting approach, to forecast the closing price of Bitcoin (BTC), Bionic (BNC), Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin (DOGE), Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP) of cryptocurrencies based on the data from September 19, 2021, to September 29, 2021. The forecast was generated for September 30, 2021¨COctober 07, 2021. Study revealed that the generalized model¡¯s forecast accuracy is generally better than that of the classical model. The results are also compared with Linear Regression and Exponential Regression. This superiority results from using real past data in long-term forecasting, while the iterative forecasting approach uses the predicted values. Since forecast values are important in guiding future investments, decision-makers must consider various forecasting methods and select the best forecast performance after analyzing the comparative performance."
Journal Article,"Tripathi M,Tripathi B",Predictive Power of An Ensemble Model for Cryptocurrency Forecasting,The Journal of Prediction Markets,2022,16,,08 2022,2022/9/24,http://dx.doi.org/10.5750/jpm.v16i1.1877,10.5750/jpm.v16i1.1877,"Cryptocurrencies have received much attention amongst investors and policymakers due to the innovative features and simplicity. However, prices of the cryptocurrencies are nonlinear and volatile, which creates challenges for the investors to forecast the cryptocurrency prices. The present study takes the price data of two important cryptocurrencies, i.e., Bitcoin and Ripple, for 2013 to 2020. The study presents the forecasting accuracy of statistical models such as random walk (RW) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and machine learning models such as artificial neural network (ANN) and ensemble model. The study develops the ensemble of RW, ARIMA, and ANN. The study compares the predictive power of all the models and demonstrates that the forecasting accuracy of the ensemble model is better than all the component models, i.e., RW, ARIMA, and ANN. The results of the study have several implications for investors, traders, and policymakers."
Journal Article,Aljadani A,DLCP2F: a DL-based cryptocurrency price prediction framework,Discover Artificial Intelligence,2022,2,,10 2022,2022/11/5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s44163-022-00036-2,10.1007/s44163-022-00036-2,"Cryptocurrencies are distributed digital currencies that have emerged as a consequence of financial technology advancement. In 2017, cryptocurrencies have shown a huge rise in their market capitalization and popularity. They are now employed in today¡¯s financial systems as individual investors, corporate firms, and big institutions are heavily investing in them. However, this industry is less stable than traditional currency markets. It can be affected by several legal, sentimental, and technical factors, so it is highly volatile, dynamic, uncertain, and unpredictable, hence, accurate forecasting is essential. Recently, cryptocurrency price prediction becomes a trending research topic globally. Various machine and deep learning algorithms, e.g., Neural Networks (NN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) were utilized to analyze the factors influencing the prices of the cryptocurrencies and accordingly predict them. This paper suggests a five-phase framework for cryptocurrency price prediction based on two state-of-the-art deep learning architectures (i.e., BiLSTM and GRU). The current study uses three public real-time cryptocurrency datasets from ¡°Yahoo Finance¡±. Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit deep learning-based algorithms are used to forecast the prices of three popular cryptocurrencies (i.e., Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano). The Grid Search approach is used for the hyperparameters optimization processes. Results indicate that GRU outperformed the BiLSTM algorithm for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, respectively. The lowest RMSE for the GRU model was found to be 0.01711, 0.02662, and 0.00852 for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Cardano, respectively. Experimental results proved the significant performance of the proposed framework that achieves the minimum MSE and RMSE values."
Journal Article,"Moreno EA,Garcia Medina A",LSTM-GARCH Hybrid Model for the Prediction of Volatility in Cryptocurrency Portfolios,SSRN Electronic Journal,2022,,,2022,2022/8/18,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4132498,10.2139/ssrn.4132498,"The time series movements of Bitcoin prices are commonly characterized as highly nonlinear and volatile in nature across economic periods, when compared to the characteristics of traditional asset classes, such as equities and commodities. From a risk management perspective, such behaviors pose challenges, given the difficulty in quantifying and modeling Bitcoin¡¯s price volatility. In this study, we propose hybrid analytical techniques that combine the strengths of the non-stationary properties of Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models with the nonlinear modeling capabilities of deep learning algorithms, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) algorithms with single, double, and triple layer network architectures to forecast Bitcoin¡¯s realized price volatility. Our findings, both in-sample and out-of-sample, show that such hybrid models can generate accurate forecasts of Bitcoin¡¯s price volatility."

Journal Article,Vitt DC,Breaking Bitcoin: Does Cryptocurrency Exchange Activity Lead to Increased Real Activity Outside Cryptocurrency Exchanges?,SSRN Electronic Journal,2013,,,2013,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2371343,10.2139/ssrn.2371343,"With the birth of blockchain technology, digital assets such as Bitcoin have also rapidly developed. In recent years, although the development of digital assets has been blocked by national policies, it is still favored by many investors in the capital market. Today, the price of Bitcoin has reached as high as 4000 $, and some early investors in Bitcoin have received rich returns. But the fluctuations in bitcoin prices are also difficult for investors to ponder, and even let some people lose their money. By analyzing the factors affecting the price of bitcoin, this paper predicts the trend of bitcoin price through linear regression model through the difficulty of mining based on POW mechanism and people¡¯s attention to digital assets (Google Trend Index), thus providing investors with some reference comments."
Journal Article,"Toledo JM,Souza DY",Signal Prediction in Cryptocurrency Tradeoperations: A Machine Learning-Based Approach,SSRN Electronic Journal,2022,,,2022,,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4062476,10.2139/ssrn.4062476,"This study examines the predictability of three major cryptocurrencies¡ªbitcoin, ethereum, and litecoin¡ªand the profitability of trading strategies devised upon machine learning techniques (e.g., linear models, random forests, and support vector machines). The models are validated in a period characterized by unprecedented turmoil and tested in a period of bear markets, allowing the assessment of whether the predictions are good even when the market direction changes between the validation and test periods. The classification and regression methods use attributes from trading and network activity for the period from August 15, 2015 to March 03, 2019, with the test sample beginning on April 13, 2018. For the test period, five out of 18 individual models have success rates of less than 50%. The trading strategies are built on model assembling. The ensemble assuming that five models produce identical signals (Ensemble 5) achieves the best performance for ethereum and litecoin, with annualized Sharpe ratios of 80.17% and 91.35% and annualized returns (after proportional round-trip trading costs of 0.5%) of 9.62% and 5.73%, respectively. These positive results support the claim that machine learning provides robust techniques for exploring the predictability of cryptocurrencies and for devising profitable trading strategies in these markets, even under adverse market conditions."

The historical prices show that cryptocurrencies have experienced significant price fluctuations on both daily and long term valuations. Cryptocurrency market movement prediction systems have emerged to help people make an informed decision. Traditional supervised learning algorithms were used for predicting changes in cryptocurrency prices based on historical price data. Nowadays, the number of news available on the internet is increasing rapidly. Discerning the impact of news on price movement can provide a buying and selling advantage to an investor. In this paper, we describe a method for predicting cryptocurrency prices utilizing news and historical price data. Our paper analyses the ability of news data to predict price fluctuations for the second largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization: Ethereum. The model is able to directly predict price direction by indicating whether to buy, sell, or hold. The final version of the model was able to correctly predict cryptocurrency price using historical data and sentimental information gained from news data. The important key in our model is the application of a set of natural language processing algorithms to identify the public moods for cryptocurrency fluctuations. We showed that sentiment analysis is an important perspective for cryptocurrency price prediction due to the interactive nature of financial activities."
